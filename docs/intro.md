# Introduction
Welcome to Warehouse! An asset library flexible enough to store any kind of asset, from images and videos to DCC scenes and code snippets.


The primary purpose of the library is to store files, as well as allow for quick discovery and allow you to quickly discover and reuse them in your current project.<br/>
If you don't work with Volt you are able to copy filepaths and use them as is in your apps.<br/>
If you do use Volt however you will need to either ingest Warehouse files into your Volt workarea or copy them to your workarea's external files directory. You can find more information about this process in the workflows section.

Warehouse stores assets in a flat hierarchy and categorises them dynamically based on rules. As such it is not advised to browse it using the file system directly but rather through the UI.

Feel free to reach out (@george) for any questions or assistance, or to provide feedback and report issues.
