The Warehouse UI is divided in 2 main sections. On the left side you have the browser and the right side the details of any asset or assets you have selected.

# Browser
The browser will present currently filtered assets on a grid, also displaying the first preview of each asset. You will learn about previews later on but for now you can think of them as different ways to visualise an asset. These grid items, called “asset tiles”, can be resized and viewed in different aspect ratios via the controls at the bottom of the browser. There you will also be able to change how many assets to load per page.

Left clicking any asset will set it as your current selection while right clicking will let you perform useful actions like copying its path.

A quick way to filter assets is by using the field at the centre top of the UI, but keep in mind your results are also filtered by your selected collection.

## Collections
As stated in the introduction, warehouse stores assets in a flat hierarchy. Collections allow for categorising assets using rules. Clicking on a collection will filter assets using the collection hierarchy.

# Asset Details
On the right side of the UI you will find details of your current selection. At the very top there’s the media viewer, below that some basic info about the asset like its name and path, followed by its tags. At the bottom there’s the component list.

## Media Viewer
Assets will (usually) come with previews, which are displayed here. The top area of the viewer can be used to select between them.

## Component List
This is where you will find the list of files that make up your selected asset. Right clicking on one of the components will pop a menu with useful actions such as copying the filepath to your clipboard.
