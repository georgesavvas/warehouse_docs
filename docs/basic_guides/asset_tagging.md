Tags are initially set up by artists when creating an asset but can easily be changed at any point.

There’s 2 ways to edit tags of a selected asset.
## Edit tags
On the asset details section, flip the “Edit” switch next to its tags. The UI will change to allow you to add and remove tags. Make sure you flip the switch back to avoid accidental changes.

:::tip
When adding tags make sure you hit enter after typing each tag.

## Edit Asset
On the asset details section click the “Edit” button for the asset editor window to open up. Alternatively you can right click on an asset tile and select "Edit". The asset editor will open up where you can change anything about the asset, including its tags at the centre top.
