Tags are initially set up when creating an asset but can easily be changed afterwards. With your asset selected head over to the details section on the right side.

There’s 2 ways to edit tags of a selected asset.
## Edit Asset
On the asset details section click the “Edit” button for the asset editor window to open up. Here you can change anything about the asset, including its tags at the centre top.

## Edit tags
On the asset details section, flip the “Edit” switch next to its tags. The UI will change to allow you to add and remove tags. Make sure you flip the switch back to avoid accidental changes.

When adding tags make sure you hit enter after typing each tag.
