title: Running Workflows
---
import ReactPlayer from "react-player";
import WorkflowIngestModelVideo from "../assets/workflow_ingest_model.mp4";
import WorkflowCreateBuildVideo from "../assets/workflow_create_build.mp4";

With an asset selected, you will find available workflows to run above the component list on the right side of the UI. Simply click on any of them to run it. If the workflow requires input (for example which Volt workarea to ingest to) an interface will pop up for you to provide relevant details before running it.
