import SearchingVideo from "../assets/search.mp4";

You can quickly search for assets by using the bar at the centre top of the UI. Keep in mind your results are also filtered by your selected collection. If you want to search the entire library   make sure you have selected the “All” studio collection.

<ReactPlayer playing loop controls width="100%" height="auto" url={SearchingVideo} /><br/>

If you require more complex filtering please see the [advanced filtering guide](../advanced_guides/advanced_filtering.md).
