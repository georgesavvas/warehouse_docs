When publishing an asset the most important things are its name, tags and components. Make sure you fill in the name and tags fields at the top and then head over to the “Components” column.

Each component will require a name and either a filepath or some file content to be pasted in. Select the appropriate options and when ready click the “Create” button at the bottom right of the screen.

Using the trolley
You can add and remove items to the trolley by toggling the trolley icon on the asset details section. To view added items hover over the trolley area on the left edge of the UI.

Apart from being able to quickly cycle through added items, the trolley is also useful to run workflows on multiple assets. Simply mark the ones you want to run a workflow on and use the buttons at the bottom.
