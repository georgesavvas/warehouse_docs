When publishing an asset the most important things are its name, tags and components. Make sure you fill in the name and tags fields at the top and then head over to the “Components” column.

Each component will require a name and either a filepath or some file content to be pasted in. Select the appropriate options and when ready click the “Create” button at the bottom right of the screen.
