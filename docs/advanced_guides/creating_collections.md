Private collections are freely editable as you wish. Studio collections on the other hand are shared with everyone, as such only a single artist at a time is allowed to edit them. In either case you can start editing by using the blue lock icon on the top right of each collection section.

You can create, edit and remove collections with the right click menu. You may also move them around by click and dragging.

When editing a collection the UI will be similar to asset filtering from the previous advanced filtering guide.
